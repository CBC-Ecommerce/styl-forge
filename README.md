### Wins and Improvements
The Front-End Capstone project was a success! The application was built using modern technologies and the code was well-structured and organized. The project was completed on time and all of the features were implemented as expected.

There are also some areas that could be improved. The code could be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. While we did make an effort to comply with accessibility standards, there are some noticeable improvements that we could make.
